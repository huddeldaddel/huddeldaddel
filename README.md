### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a multidirectional retro scrolling shooter called [Retro-Carnage](https://github.com/huddeldaddel/retro-carnage). Once finished, Retro-Carnage is hopefully going to be a worthy successor of classic video games like Ikari Warriors by SNK, War Zone by Core Design, or Dogs of War by Elite Systems.

ðŸ‘¯ If you'd like to collaborate on this: any support is welcome.
